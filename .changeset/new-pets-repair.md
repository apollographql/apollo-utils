Introduce package which extracts `KeyValueCache`, `PrefixingKeyValueCache`, and `InMemoryLRUCache` from Apollo Server and adds a separate Keyv adapter which implements the `KeyValueCache` interface. This also introduces an `ErrorsAreMissesCache` for adding tolerance and logging to errors when using caching clients which might be susceptible to connection failures or other types of errors.
