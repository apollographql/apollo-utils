Update lru-cache dependency from v7.x to v9.x

The `InMemoryLRUCache` constructor accepts an `LRUCache.Options` object. This type has changed since v8.x, so you may need to update your usages accordingly.

The changes in the options typings aren't documented in the changelog; please look at the source below for specifics.

v7 options can be derived [here](https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache/blob/7a6f529e2e7c1bc3c81f3ee996267ef2006de492/index.d.ts#L615).
v8-9 options can be derived [here](https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache/blob/88bb31c82d418488a18f1663a2a6383853b632a1/src/index.ts#L763).
