  # These are the steps used for each version of Node which we're testing
  # against.  Thanks to YAMLs inability to merge arrays (though it is able
  # to merge objects), every version of Node must use the exact same steps,
  # or these steps would need to be repeated in a version of Node that needs
  # something different.  Probably best to avoid that, out of principle, though.
