# @apollo/utils.keyvaluecache

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#93](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-utils/pull/93) [`7ce10c7`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-utils/commit/7ce10c7bdf8dce0f7ee59e37ae9c973139b6de13) Thanks [@trevor-scheer](https://github.com/trevor-scheer)! - Introduce package which extracts `KeyValueCache`, `PrefixingKeyValueCache`, and `InMemoryLRUCache` from Apollo Server and adds a separate Keyv adapter which implements the `KeyValueCache` interface. This also introduces an `ErrorsAreMissesCache` for adding tolerance and logging to errors when using caching clients which might be susceptible to connection failures or other types of errors.
