### Minor Changes

- [#182](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-utils/pull/182) [`995c791`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-utils/commit/995c7915cb4159fd5ed7c343fff634412dcefc6b) Thanks [@glasser](https://github.com/glasser)! - FetcherRequestInit: add optional `signal?: any` to support aborting fetches. We believe that due to using `any`, this should not cause any function that implements `Fetcher` to stop typechecking, and we believe all of the most common implementations do support `signal`.
